          <span>Challenge</span>

          <div>
            With Millenials moving towards an information-rich world where severely low patience level has affected the decision making ability of the individual, it is important that the consumption and well as sharing of the content be crisp and to the point! <br> <br>
            Millenials today do not like the idea of using the traditional investment options where a broker who understands market flow guides them what to do through an app or email or a phone call, they want to have full control in their own hand. <br><br>
            But investment decisions cannot be made just based on a glance. So a product has be crafted so that it’s a one-stop trust-based solution in the sense that it is something which the millennials would love to refer to before they make an investment decision.

          During the course of the task, I got to interact with almost half a dozen people in the Financial world, thus got a lot of information from there. My father being in the banking sector and my sister being a  Millenial herself helped me connect with these people though whom I was able to understand the problem statement and come up with a solution which I think is perfect for all the User Personas.
          <br><br>Apart from that, I myself having zero knowledge of FInancial Markets pondered upon it for 2-3 Days, so parallely I observed how I approached towards a problem and what was my thought process towards achieving it!
