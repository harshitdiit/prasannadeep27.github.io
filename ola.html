            This summer, I got the unparalleled opportunity to Intern as a Product Designer at Ola Cabs ( ANI Technologies Pvt. Ltd. ) in Bengaluru, India from 13 May’19 to 13 August’19. The constant support and guidance from the team of exceptionally talented individuals and leaders really helped build an amazing learning environment for me.

          <span>Introduction</span>

          <div>
            Ola is India’s largest mobility platform and one of the world’s largest ride-hailing companies, serving 250+ cities across India, Australia, New Zealand, and the UK. The Ola app offers mobility solutions by connecting customers to drivers and a wide range of vehicles across bikes, auto-rickshaws, metered taxis, and cabs, enabling convenience and transparency for hundreds of millions of consumers and over 1.5 million driver-partners.
            <br><br>Launched in 2011, Ola is India’s first real-time ride-hailing platform. One that truly democratized mobility solutions across the country and empowered hundreds of millions of Indians to lead better liver. The journey of Ola Mobility started with just one button that said “Pick me up!” and a map showing the nearby cabs in Mumbai.

          As I was a Product Design Intern, I worked closely with different teams of Product i.e. Product managers, Tech, Marketing and Design. Design team itself has four major verticals, one looked after the consumer experience (passenger side), another after the merchant experience (driver side) and there were two other teams, one looked after all the creatives (illustrations) that were used anywhere by Ola and the last team was that of Content.
During my internship, I was a part of the Consumer App team and was mentored by Agniva Si. Ola Design has a really progressive work culture, where I learnt a lot from other buddying designers who helped me turn my half learnt skills into well nourished implementations!0

          I was assigned with real-time live projects and with that came great responsibility. The expectations were really challenging and at times apprehensive, especially at the start, being thrown into the deep end which eventually bought out the best in me and helped me contribute efficiently! Here is what I worked on:
<br><br><b>Asset Management System:</b><br>
Ola has launched a new feature of Self Drive for which an android app for the Yard Manager had to be designed.
<br><br><b>Ola Design System:</b><br>
Ola Cabs is revamping the design of its mobile application, which will be launched in the beginning of 2020. Designing a Language understood by the whole team was of high priority, thus a Design System was crafted.
<br><br><b>Ola Notifications System:</b><br>
Right from “Search Cab” to “Ride has Started”, the experience matters a lot and to keep this link in tact a perfect notification system was required.

        <img id="project-upper-image" src="Assets/images/Ola/img4.png">

        These project I worked on are currently under development phase, thus is under <b>Non-Disclosure Agreement</b>. To learn more about the projects I worked on, <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=15pRs9EbZTCOGooD_y9vFEHfbBVDy4e1y" style="color:#E7BD53" target="_blank">click here</a>

        <span>Abstract</span>

        <div>
          During mid May, Ola had already started working on Self Drive and an App was required for the Yard Managers where they could monitor, assign, handover and finally get back the cars. Considering the target audience, the main challenge was to keep the app as simple, with the least touch points as possible.
So by the time I joined as an intern and took up this project, the team has already done the UX part and had also formed the Information Architecture and designed the wireframes.What was left was designing the Interface of the Tablet app of Ola which the Yard Managers would be using.<br>
The self drive cars to be deployed in different regions of the country were planned to be stationed at particular places in the city, known as yards. So once a customer has booked a car through Ola Self Drive has to go to that particular Yard and pick up the car assigned.
So in between this, the Yard Manager gets a booking request and accordingly uses the tablet app provided by Ola to assign a particular car to that customer. Thus as per the requirement of the flow, the following screens were designed:<br>
<br><b>Home Screen:</b><br>
Yard managers are generally not that tech-savvy, thus need a very simple but effective Interaction to do their job. So the landing page designed was to be simple and to the point. So we divided all the bookings into three categories: “All”, “Pick-Ups” and “Drop-Offs”. Maximum relevant information such as the Booking ID, Details of the customer as well as the Car assigned  detailed were tried to put together so that the yard manager got to know about the booking from the first glance itself.

      <img id="project-upper-image" src="Assets/images/ola/img5.png">

      <br><b>Checklist:</b><br>
      If a Yard Manager blocks a particular car for servicing and maintenance, there was a certain checklist he was required to fill before and after the maintenance. The Checklist was used to maintain a track of the condition of the car, and relevant images of the damages were also to be added so that the customer knows what it is renting.

      <img id="project-upper-image" src="Assets/images/ola/img6.png">

      <br><b>Other Screens:</b><br>
      As a particular yard had around 50-100 cars, it was really important for the yard manager to keep a track of its service and maintenance. There were different cases a car could be in, thus tags were provided so that the Yard Manager got to know in the first instinct which car to assign and which car was to be sent for servicing.

      <img id="project-upper-image" src="Assets/images/ola/img7.png">

      The Pending section was divided into two parts, “Bookings” and “Car Tasks”. All the new new bookings that came up and were not assigned a car was to be under Pending Bookings and cars which were marked to be damaged and were to be sent for service came under the Pending Car Tasks. Any car which was marked to have Pending Tasks couldn’t be assigned to a particular booking as safety is of major concern in the industry of mobility.

      <img id="project-upper-image" src="Assets/images/ola/img8.png">

      With so many cars to maintain and handle, it becomes really difficult for the Yard Managers to remember which car have they given for service and which car for Self Drive. Thus sometimes they remember the car number, sometimes the model of the car and sometimes just the date when the car was lent for Self Drive, thus a prominent feature of search was required in the app. And also getting the hang of the present status of the car was required hence a particular car had its own page for itself where all the details regarding the car was mentioned.
