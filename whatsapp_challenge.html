            Imagine, you are a part of WhatsApp’s Design team. The team plans to release a new feature,
            “Polls” in group chats and you are working on this feature as a Product Designer. Few things
            that are going to be part of the flow which your solution has to cover: <br><br>

            <ul>
              <li>Creation of a poll by a user in a group</li>
              <li>Other users being able to vote for the poll</li>
              <li>Displaying and sharing results</li>
              <li>Any use cases or edge cases to be handled</li>
              <li>Anything additional required for a great experience</li>
            </ul>

          <span>Abstract</span>
          <div>
            In September 2018, I got this internship task from Razorpay, which was to be done in 24hrs. Considering that WhatsApp’s product and design teams work independently of the parent organisation, Facebook and following the WhatsApp’s design ideology, i.e. keeping it simple and using native design, I tried to introduce “Polls” in WhatsApp! Polls already existing in Messenger, Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, made decisions making convenient as well as tricky at the same time.

        <span>Assumptions</span>
        <div>
          As the time frame of the challenge being really short, there were a number of assumptions I took :
          <ul>
            <li>Out of different kinds of groups that prevail, Informal chats are the ones which are in dominance. People rarely use WhatsApp for Official purpose.</li>
            <li>The WhatsApp feature “Payment” hasn’t been introduced yet, and the “Camera” feature is still present in “Add Media”.</li>
            <li>As mentioned in the problem statement, I being a part of the design team of WhatsApp have a say in addition/subtraction of elements as and when required. </li>
            <li>Decisions made are in accordance with the Indian Janta.</li>

        <span>Random Brainstorming</span>
        <div>
          Initially to find a point to start, I started with writing down random thoughts and questions that came in my mind related to Polls. A few of them were:

          <ul>
            <li>Why do we need polls?</li>
            <li>Who’s going to use it?</li>
            <li>Which all applications have existing polls feature?</li>
            <li>Is it going to be a text based poll or image based?</li>
            <li>How frequently is it going to be used?</li>
            <li>Should the results be shown to all or just the poll creator?</li>
            <li>Is the Admin involvement required?</li>
            <li>Real-time results or the results after the voting is done?</li>
            <li>How do we create Polls?             </li>
          </ul>
        </div>

      <article class="project-lower-article">
        <span>Competitive Analysis</span>

        <div>
          To start of with, I planned to learn about the existing polls in other competitive applications. Understanding their methodology and presentation might lead me towards the solution. So, Facebook, Instagram, Messenger & Inshorts were the 4 main applications, whose Polls service I analyzed.

        <span>Understanding the Target Audience</span>
        <div>
          So I divided the user base into two demographic categories, considering the fact that people now a days are psychographically quite familiar with messaging apps:

          <ul>
            <li>People who are technologically well versed, i.e. students, entrepreneurs & corporates.</li>
            <li>People who aren’t much comfortable with new technology and take time to become familiar with the new tech.</li>
          </ul>

          Then I went on to find out, what the polls are going to be. Who will be putting up posts, why will he/she use WhatsApp to put up a poll, and why specifically polls in groups? So I decided to talk to a few colleagues who extensively used social media applications to get a better understanding of use cases.
